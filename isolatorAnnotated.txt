Based on our animal experiments in which -3630- administration reversed the metabolic and ECG changes induced by scorpion envenoming and treating the poisonous scorpion sting victims with -3630-, we consider that -3630- has a primary metabolic role in preventing and reversing the cardiovascular, haemodynamic, and neurological manifestations and pulmonary oedema induced by scorpion envenoming$	and>3	t
The postoperative results indicated that the modified Lansbury's index (morning stiffness, grip power, ESR, joint score), the values of ESR, CRP, Hb, -7124- and -3569- in the blood, and the peripheral lymphocyte -920- -925- ratio were improved, with a statistically significant difference$	and>1	t
The liver plays many roles in this regulation, including the synthesis of plasminogen, -5345- (-5345-) and -5054- (-5054-), and the clearance of tissue-plasminogen activator (-5327-)$	and>1	t

We speculate that they may constitute an important control mechanism in the -761- region and the hilus, and impairment of this mechanism may be causal to delayed neuronal death in -759-$	and>1	t
We have examined the following possible linked markers in 69 relatives in this family: the c-ret gene (HSCR); the human -5077- gene (-5077-) on chromosome 2q (-5077-) and placental alkaline phosphatase (-250-) on chromosome 2q (linked to -5077-); argininosuccinate synthetase (ASS) on chromosome 9q, close to ABO blood groups which have shown weak linkage to WS; and the beta 1 GABA receptor gene (GABARB1) on chromosome 4q13-11, close to -3815-, deletions of which cause piebaldism$	and>1	t

Molecular abnormalities have been reported in some cases (allele loss at the 11q13 locus, retinoblastoma gene mutation, aberrant expression of -2249- gene, -5449- overexpression) but none by itself can explain the tumour formation$	but>0	t
Without cytokine, most eosinophils died by day 3 in culture, but human recombinant -3567-, -3562-, -1437-, and -3458- enhanced eosinophil survival in a dose-dependent manner$	but>0	t
Bright -25699- (-25699-) immunofluorescence was observed in the majority of eyelid-projecting neurons within the superior cervical ganglia (65 + - 5%) and lighter staining was detected in pterygopalatine neurons (63 + - 3%), but no -25699- -ir was observed in trigeminal neurons$	and>0	t
